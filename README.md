# Senior Design Contract 
## Project Summary 

When starting in the University of Cincinnati’s early IT program, you can start taking first year
classes while you are in high school. The problem with the early IT program is that some 
students don’t know what classes are teaching what. When they start taking these classes, they 
don’t know what track they are truly interested in.
Our project is to create three minigames that students can play when CECH recruitment goes 
and visits high schools and teaches them about the early IT program. Our minigames will be 
web-based and for 10-25 players. Each minigame will be focused on a certain track in the IT 
program and will be like a jackbox game that asks you questions. For example, when the 
recruitment team is talking about the cyber security track, they can have the students play our 
game to learn more about what the cyber security track is.
This project from the CECH recruitment team is a very large project. Originally, they wanted to 
have a minigame for each track in the IT program (6 minigames). Our project is just 3 
minigames, so just a start to their end goal. We hope to push this project in the right direction 
by helping the CECH recruiting team and the early IT students.

## Problem Statement

When starting down the IT/CS tracks, it is hard to know what you are getting into. When you 
start down this track, people normally have minimal to no knowledge of the IT field. The 
University of Cincinnati’s early IT program educates high school students on the IT program and 
the different tracks that the program has to offer. When the CECH recruitment team goes to 
these high schools to teach students about the early IT program, they have issues with keeping 
students engaged and getting them to learn about each track.
A common issue that many high school teachers must manage is student engagement.
Iberdrola states, “Many parents distrust video consoles and don't want them in the house 
because they are afraid that they will damage their children's performance at school. However, 
the benefits of video games include improved powers of concentration, creativity, memory, 
languages and teamwork” (Iberdrola, 2021). An educational video game designed to educate
can help students stay engaged while still learning. Iberdrola also states, “Videogames can 
make it easier to learn educational contents and develop cognitive skills” (Iberdrola, 2021). The 
CECH recruiters are having issues with keeping students engaged, we feel that minigames can 
help them with their visits.

## Solution

Our solution is to create three minigames that will educate students in three different aspects 
of IT. These games will assist the CECH recruitment team by engaging the students in a fun and 
interactive game that gives them knowledge of the different tracks. The recruitment team will 
have the students play these minigames while on visits to different high schools.

## Project Source

Originally for our project we had a basic idea of wanting to create some kind of game for 
younger students that could be used to help introduce them to or simplify IT. When we first got 
to meet with our advisors we talked to Shane, and he told us about a project sponsor through 
the University with the CECH Recruitment Team. He introduced us to Corbin and Camille who 
both work within the recruitment team. Camille explained how when she goes to visit students 
of the early IT program it is hard to keep them engaged. We saw this as the perfect opportunity 
since it aligned with our original idea but with more direction. Now we are looking at creating 
an activity/game for multiple early IT courses such as Networking or Fundamentals of IT.

## Project Objectives/Goals

• Create 3 minigames for the CECH Recruitment team.
• Make the games interactive while teaching the students about 3 different tracks.
• One minigame will be about the cyber security track, the other two are TBD. Waiting on 
a response from our sponsor. 
• Make the minigames multiplayer for 10-25 students.
• Make the games browser-compatible.
• Each game should take less than 20 minutes to complete.


## Team Members and Responsibilities

• Manage database and user data after games are played
### Backend Game Developer – Grant Chapel

## Project Scope

Our team will develop 3 functional minigames for the CECH recruitment team that helps users 
further extend their knowledge of the different IT tracks that UCs IT program has to offer. 
• Creating the framework for the minigames.
• Researching the necessary content for each game.
• Setting up a database to record user performance.
• Securing a web and database for the games.
• Figuring out the art style of the games. 
• We will be building a low fidelity prototype that shows a basic concept of our game.

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

Our game(s) must include accessibility options for users to maintain ethical integrity. Having 
adjustable difficulty levels and colorblind options, amongst other options, will provide for a 
more accessible and inclusive game (Bindumon, 2023). We must also ensure that any user data 
collected is handled and stored in compliance with U.S. law.
These minigames are focused towards a younger audience, high school students ranging from 
15-19 years old. These games are for educational reasons as well, so there is no reason for us to
create a game with anything rated above a PG level. We must ensure that we keep the content 
of the minigames to PG and below.
IARC (International Age Rating Coalition) is a “globally streamlined age classification process for 
digital games and mobile apps, helping to ensure that today's digital consumers have consistent 
access to established and trusted age ratings across game devices” (IARC Ratings for Mobile and 
Digitally Delivered, 2023). We plan to go through the process of getting our minigames certified 
before publishing them to students. As this is a sponsored project, the ownership is still in 
conversation at this time. Copyright licenses we will use will be Creative Commons.
